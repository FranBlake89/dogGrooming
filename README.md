# Dog Grooming Application

## Project Description:

This desktop application simplifies the pet registration process, providing a comprehensive platform to record essential information about pets and the services they require. The system meticulously manages details pertaining to both the pets and their respective owners. 

**Technical Implementation:**

The application is developed using Java, Swing, and MySQL on the Windows platform. The core structure involves two classes, 'Pet' and 'Owner,' maintaining a One-to-One relationship. Future plans include transitioning to Many-to-Many for enhanced scalability.

The system provides users with the capability to input new records, storing them in a MySQL database. Additionally, users can view, modify, and delete records, adhering to the CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations. An exit button is incorporated, displaying a message to the user before termination.

## Versions:

- **v0.8:** Uploaded to Github with basic functionality.
- **v0.9:** Added back button, fixed screen navigation, addressed design form issues.

## To Do:

- [ ] Add a list of dog breeds to enable user searches.
- [ ] Create a form to add owners.
- [ ] Modify the relationship from One-to-One to Many-to-Many.
- [ ] Implement a list of owners, allowing creation if not already present.
- [ ] Develop a function to search owners within a combo box.
- [ ] Integrate user permission functionality.

**Results:**

The outcome is a desktop application that empowers users with CRUD functionalities, facilitating the management of pet and owner records.
